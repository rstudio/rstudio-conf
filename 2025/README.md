## Keynotes

## Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science 

💬 Speaker(s): Hadley Wickham; Joe Cheng 

 📝 Abstract: 

This presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies. We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.

### 10 Years of Data Science Tools... and What Happens Next 

💬 Speaker(s): Jonathan McPherson 

 📝 Abstract: 

In this talk, I'll reflect on a decade of work on RStudio and the principles of tool-building that have led it to become the standard data science environment for R. We'll talk about how those same principles have guided the development of Positron, a new data science environment from Posit, and how you can apply them to your own tool-building work.

### Trustworthy Data Visualization 

💬 Speaker(s): Kieran Healy 

 📝 Abstract: 

Visualizations are the most widespread, the most immediately accessible, and in some ways the most authoritative-looking way to present results to audiences, including when the audience is just yourself. In this talk I ask: what makes a visualization trustworthy? How do tools like R and ggplot to help us achieve that goal? And what are their limits, especially now that it's easier than it has ever been to do untrustworthy things with data.

### The Psychology of Technologists 

💬 Speaker(s): Cat Hicks 

 📝 Abstract: 

Technology teams are struggling to be heard. Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.

### Web applications with Shiny and React (and AI) 

💬 Speaker(s): Winston Chang 

 📝 Abstract: 

If you've ever wanted to have complete control over the UI for a Shiny application, this talk might be for you. In this talk I'll show how to integrate a back end written in **Shiny** (for R or Python) with a front end written in **React.js**. This lets you combine Shiny's reactivity with the flexibility of the React web development ecosystem. While writing a React front end was once a large time investment, today's **agentic AI coding tools** can make it feasible even for smaller-scale applications. Even with AI involved, you will still need to know some React or be willing to learn about it.

### shinystate: Launching collaboration and session management to new heights in Shiny applications 

💬 Speaker(s): Eric Nantz 

 📝 Abstract: 

Shiny is being used more regularly as a front end to sophisticated workflows in data science, often with a large number of inputs and intricate reactivity. End users desire a way to save their progress through the application workflow and share their state of the application with others for review. For small applications, the existing Shiny bookmarkable state feature is a valid approach. However, many of the production Shiny applications I've created require more granular control. Enter **{shinystate}**, my new R package that offers an intuitive class system and integration with **{pins}** to let developers choose where to save application state, ability to save multiple sessions at once, and bring **collaboration** to new heights for end users.

### Use Your Data Skills for Good: Ideas for Community Service 

💬 Speaker(s): Sharon Machlis


 📝 Abstract: 

 Community service doesn't have to mean finding a group where your skills match their needs. You can also see a data-related need and jump in to fill it.

Are there interesting things to do in your town, but no one place to find them? You could create a searchable, auto-updating local events calendar.

Do you live someplace where local election results aren't published the way you'd like people to see them? If  data is publicly available, you could analyze and publish it yourself.

You'll leave this session with some ideas on how your data skills can help your community -- even if you're not ready to commit to formal volunteering with an outside organization.

### Putting an {ellmer} AI in production with the blessing of IT 

💬 Speaker(s): Andrie de Vries 

 📝 Abstract: 

I had an idea to automate a process by letting an AI extract information from PDF attachments. 

Writing the 20 lines of  {ellmer} code was very simple.

My users loved the idea.

But IT had different feelings, especially initially.

It took multiple design changes to get IT comfortable with running experiments in our financial system. They need a solution that is secure, with guardrails, wouldn’t leak sensitive information and could be easily maintained.

We wrote a simple browser extension to reduce the friction of copy/paste between different systems.

If you want to put an AI in production, make sure you consider the impact on other teams, in particular IT and Information security.

### Birthing the pregnancy package 

💬 Speaker(s): Ella Kaye 

 📝 Abstract: 

 When I was pregnant, I wrote a personal, private package for date and medication calculations, hard-coded with my data. I thought it would be easy to adapt for general use, but no! I wanted the user experience to be excellent, but how to avoid them repeatedly entering the same due date and meds? How to print useful, nicely formatted, grammatically correct information to the console? How to test a package that relies on the current date? Using the pregnancy package as a case study, I'll show how to take advantage of base R features such as global options and %||%, how the cli and rlang packages came to the rescue for messages and how testthat's new mocking features saved the day (literally!) to create a package that's a pleasure to use.
