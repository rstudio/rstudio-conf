## Keynotes


    

### Making the most of artificial and human intelligence for data science 

💬 Speaker(s): Hadley Wickham; Joe Cheng

 📝 Abstract: 

This presentation explores the complex and often contradictory nature of large language models (LLMs) in data science, acknowledging the simultaneous excitement and apprehension that we feel toward these technologies. We’ll provide a practical framework to help you understand the LLM ecosystem (from foundation models and hosting to SDKs and applications) that supports our current philosophy: augmenting, not replacing human intelligence. The talk demonstrates how Posit is addressing this space through two complementary approaches: building SDKs and tools that help you create your own LLM-powered solutions, and developing integrated LLM capabilities directly into data science workflows through tools like Positron assistant and databot. We’ll showcase practical, immediately useful applications while addressing current limitations, providing you with both the emotional preparation and technical foundation needed to effectively leverage LLMs in their data science practice today.

### 10 Years of Data Science Tools... and What Happens Next 

💬 Speaker(s): Jonathan McPherson

 📝 Abstract: 

In this talk, I'll reflect on a decade of work on RStudio and the principles of tool-building that have led it to become the standard data science environment for R. We'll talk about how those same principles have guided the development of Positron, a new data science environment from Posit, and how you can apply them to your own tool-building work.

### Trustworthy Data Visualization 

💬 Speaker(s): Kieran Healy

 📝 Abstract: 

Visualizations are the most widespread, the most immediately accessible, and in some ways the most authoritative-looking way to present results to audiences, including when the audience is just yourself. In this talk I ask: what makes a visualization trustworthy? How do tools like R and ggplot to help us achieve that goal? And what are their limits, especially now that it's easier than it has ever been to do untrustworthy things with data?

### The Psychology of Technologists 

💬 Speaker(s): Cat Hicks

 📝 Abstract: 

Technology teams are struggling to be heard. Technologists are grappling with high turnover, high burnout, and low resilience in the face of rapidly-accelerating technological change. Even though effective technical teams are an essential part of our world continuing to work, many organizations struggle to understand their technical teams, stuck in old stereotypes that treat technical people like isolated machines. To build a thriving future, we need a new way of working together and understanding our own minds as we build technology. In my empirical research across thousands of developers, technical managers and their teams, we've explored what a psychologically-rich environment looks like for modern technologists and found important signals that can guide teams toward greater resilience, innovation, and thriving. In this keynote we'll unlock access to the psychological sciences and evidence that you can use to make your every day more human.

### Positron for Babies: Communicating Technical Concepts to all Audiences 

💬 Speaker(s): Ryan Johnson

 📝 Abstract: 

Data science is full of complex topics—Bayesian statistics, neural networks, databases, and more. Now, imagine teaching one of these to a baby. What would you say? How would you say it? This exercise highlights the power of simplification: anyone can teach, and anyone can learn. Breaking down complexity makes data science accessible, impactful, and fosters greater creativity and flexibility. In this talk, I’ll share my approach to simplifying data science education with a playful demonstration using Posit’s new IDE, Positron, as the focus!

### Web applications with Shiny and React (and AI)

💬 Speaker(s): Winston Chang

If you've ever wanted to have complete control over the UI for a Shiny application, this talk might be for you. In this talk I'll show how to integrate a back end written in Shiny (for R or Python) with a front end written in React.js. This lets you combine Shiny's reactivity with the flexibility of the React web development ecosystem.

In the past, writing a front end in React was a large time investment, and would be reserved only for a serious project. However, with today's agentic AI coding tools, it can make sense to create a React front end even for smaller-scale applications. But even with AI involved, you will still need to know some React or be willing to learn about it.

### Teaching Data Sharing through R Data Packages 

💬 Speaker(s): Kelly McConville

 📝 Abstract: 

Data science courses tend to teach students reproducible workflows.  However, the origin of the data used in these workflows and definitions of the variables used are often not emphasized.  This talk addresses this gap by focusing on how to teach students effective data sharing through the creation of R data packages.  We’ll explore how to leverage key packages, such as devtools and usethis, and will demonstrate how to guide students in generating appropriate documentation through ReadMes, help files, and vignettes.  Furthermore, we’ll discuss common pitfalls encountered when first learning to create R packages and will propose how to structure a project assignment where an R data package serves as the primary deliverable.

### Observability at scale: Monitoring Shiny Applications with OpenTelemetry

💬 Speaker(s): Barret Schloerke

 📝 Abstract: 

Understanding what happens behind the scenes in production Shiny applications has always been challenging. When users experience slow response times or unexpected behavior, developers are left guessing where bottlenecks occur. This talk introduces OpenTelemetry integration for Shiny for R, a new approach to profiling code and understanding application behavior.

Through a chat-enabled weather application, we'll explore how complex user interactions trigger cascading events across multiple processes. You'll learn how OpenTelemetry's "high-quality, ubiquitous, and portable telemetry" can provide complete visibility into your Shiny application's performance with minimal setup... just a few environment variables!

After walking through the chat app, you'll have a taste of how to implement comprehensive monitoring for your Shiny applications in production, enabling you to proactively identify and resolve unexpected performance issues.

### shinystate: Launching collaboration and session management to new heights in Shiny applications 

💬 Speaker(s): Eric Nantz

 📝 Abstract: 

Shiny is being used more regularly as a front end to sophisticated workflows in data science, often with a large number of inputs and intricate reactivity. End users desire a way to save their progress through the application workflow and share their state of the application with others for review. For small applications, the existing Shiny bookmarkable state feature is a valid approach. However, many of the production Shiny applications I've created require more granular control. Enter {shinystate}, my new R package that offers an intuitive class system and integration with {pins} to let developers choose where to save application state, ability to save multiple sessions at once, and bring collaboration to new heights for end users.

### Building Governable ML Models with R 

💬 Speaker(s): Tom Shafer

 📝 Abstract: 

For a model to provide value in production, it must be fit for purpose, deployable, and maintainable over time. We know that R provides a host of tools and packages for building good models, but the language and ecosystem also provide tools to help us build these kinds of maintainable production systems. This talk will present techniques, adapted from software engineering, that provide a stable foundation for building models and writing all the accompanying code that's often needed to train, test, and update models over time. Those attending this talk will learn how, by centering model development on packages, writing tests, creating intuitive S3 methods, and more, we can build modularized, testable code that makes our models easier to monitor and update over time.

### Enemies to lovers: How non-programmers can make sparks fly when using testthat during package development 

💬 Speaker(s): Libby McKenna

 📝 Abstract: 

You’re just a data scientist, self-taught in R, trying to find your way in the world of package development. It’s just a package named testthat, hoping to help a developer make sure their package is operating as intended. You meet. You hate each other. The package seems a little daunting and quite frankly, a little tedious. Surely only “real” programmers use this! The package thinks you’re inept for not immediately putting it to use. As fate would have it, you attend this talk and discover you are indeed compatible. Sparks fly, a package is born. This talk will help less experienced programmers learn about testing, automated workflows, how to write good tests, and why it’s all worth it when it pays off in quality and efficiency. Steamy.

### Semantic Search for the Rest of Us with DuckDB 

💬 Speaker(s): Marcos Huerta

 📝 Abstract: 

Semantic search matches a search query against documents not just by directly matching words, but by ranking results using semantic meaning  - for example searching for “cat” could also turn up documents that have “tiger.” 
<br><br>
While many enterprise level solutions exist for semantic search, I will show a low memory  technique in Python that enables live semantic search for small to medium document collections that need to be deployed in constrained memory/ CPU environments - such as Posit Connect Cloud or a small cloud server.
<br><br>
I will show how a web app (such as Shiny for Python) using just a few hundred megabytes of memory can enable live search using the fixed array support in DuckDB, and the open source library LlamaCPP.

### Oops! I accidentally made a production dashboard 

💬 Speaker(s): Jonathan Keane

 📝 Abstract: 

As data scientists we love making decisions with data. But we also don’t always do this with our own work. Ever wonder if that dashboard you are about to spend hours updating from line charts to 3D pie charts is actually being used? With usage metrics it’s easy for you to see, analyze, and show just how much traction your app is getting. Not only does this let you decide where to prioritize your efforts, it can help you demonstrate the impact you have on your business. This talk will explore how to be data-driven with your own work and tools we have for maintaining our work when it becomes important.

### Making Things Nice in Python 

💬 Speaker(s): Rich Iannone

 📝 Abstract: 

When working on the Great Tables and Pointblank Python packages, we've tried to make them 'nice'. These packages give you a lot of convenient options, and a large volume of docs and examples. In the Python world, this might be received differently than it would be in R. Whether it was integrating Polars selectors in Great Tables or accepting a multitude of DataFrames and DB tables in Pointblank, these design choices can be seen as surprising things to established Python developers.
<br><br>
However, I argue it's good to be doing this! People are benefitting from these approaches. I'll share a few of these developer stories with the takeaway being that Python packages could and should pay attention to good user experience.

### Keeping Data Alive: Persistent Storage Options for Dynamic Cloud Applications 

💬 Speaker(s): Alex Chisholm

 📝 Abstract: 

Building cloud-based data applications that evolve over time requires persistent storage solutions. Without a way to record new information or modify datasets, applications like Shiny or Streamlit would reset after each session, losing potentially valuable information. This talk explores persistent storage options ranging from lightweight solutions like Google Sheets to scalable services like Amazon S3 and MotherDuck. We’ll also cover securing connections to these services using Posit Connect Cloud’s secret variable management. By the end, you’ll understand common persistent storage solutions, their trade-offs, and how to choose the best approach for your specific project.

### Instant Impact: Developing {docorator} to Simplify R Adoption for Teams 

💬 Speaker(s): Becca Krouse

 📝 Abstract: 

Although R supports comprehensive analysis workflows, creating polished, production-ready PDFs directly from R remained a challenge for our pharma teams. With teams facing looming deadlines, our R enablement team swiftly created {docorator}—an open-source R package that transforms R-based tables and figures into production-level PDFs. By adorning results with “decorations” like headers, footers, and page numbers, {docorator} produces seamless, polished documents. Powered by Quarto, it also auto-sizes {gt} tables for user ease. Attendees will learn how {docorator} became the missing piece in GSK’s R workflows and learn how focusing on quick, simple solutions can have a lasting impact.

### Lift Off! Building REST APIs that Fly 

💬 Speaker(s): Joe Kirincic

 📝 Abstract: 

Picture the scene: you've successfully deployed your ML model as a plumber API into production. Your company loves it! One team uses the API's predictions as an input to their own ML model. Another team displays the predictions in an internal Shiny app. But once adoption reaches a certain point, your API's performance starts to degrade. What can you do to help your service maintain high performance in the face of high demand? In this talk, we'll show some strategies for taking your API performance to the next level. Using two R packages, {yyjsonr} and {mirai}, we can augment our API with faster JSON processing and better responsiveness through asynchronous computing, allowing our services to do great things at scale at no additional cost.

### The Curse of Documentation 

💬 Speaker(s): Michael Chow

 📝 Abstract: 

In Greek mythology, Tantalus was doomed to stand with a lake of water below him and branches of fruit close above. When he went to drink the water it receded, and when he reached to eat the fruit it was blown beyond his grasp. What he needed was forever at arms length.
<br><br>
Software documentation often puts users in a similar bind. The information is there, but something doesn’t quite connect. Maybe you try and fail to adapt an example to your use case. Maybe it’s unclear how a bunch of functions fit together.
<br><br>
In this talk, I'll discuss how effective user guides--like R for Data Science and the React.js guide--break the curse. I'll focus on three factors behind effective guides: strategic information, inductive learning, and task sequencing.

### Get your ducks in a row... faster Shiny apps with DuckDB 

💬 Speaker(s): Melissa Albino Hegeman

 📝 Abstract: 

Our small team tackled sluggish Shiny applications by implementing DuckDB as a cache layer, transforming slow, resource-intensive operations into responsive user experiences. Initially, our application pulled data directly from SQL Server, performing real-time aggregations that resulted in poor response times. By restructuring our pipeline to pre-compute results in DuckDB, we significantly improved performance. This presentation demonstrates how we identified bottlenecks, implemented DuckDB integration, and measured improvements. We'll share practical examples of DuckDB integration with R, discuss trade-offs, and show how this accessible solution can benefit other small teams with limited resources.

### IDE-ntity Crisis: Choosing the Right Tool for Me 

💬 Speaker(s): Isabel Zimmerman

 📝 Abstract: 

Data practitioners have more IDE choices than ever, but not all are built for the same purpose. JupyterLab prioritizes a notebook-first experience, while VS Code focuses on software engineering with extensible features. Others, like Positron, are designed specifically for data scientists, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.
<br><br>
Understanding these trade-offs helps you find the best fit. By the end of the session, you'll have a clear framework for choosing the right IDE for your data science and analytics tasks.

### Teaching data visualization with R entirely in Quarto 

💬 Speaker(s): Claus Wilke

 📝 Abstract: 

When teaching a programming course, we may want to employ several different modes of content delivery. First, slides. (And it should be easy to integrate code and code output into them.) Second, practical exercises, where students can try out programming concepts in a guided manner. Third, an in-class live programming environment, to ad-lib during lectures. Fourth, a framework for graded assignments. Fifth, a class website. All of these components can be created with Quarto and webR. I will explain how I used these technologies for my data visualization class at UT Austin, covering how the different components work, what issues I encountered, and what I think best practices are if you want to create a similar course yourself.

### AI Coding Assistants: Hype, Help, or Hindrance? 

💬 Speaker(s): Rebecca Barter

 📝 Abstract: 

AI coding assistants like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Codeium promise to revolutionize our coding workflows—but how useful are they in practice? Are they our new overlords here to take our jobs? Or just a passing gimmick? I think the reality lies somewhere in between, and that understanding these tools is key to staying relevant in today’s rapidly evolving data science ecosystem.
<br><br>
In this talk, I'll show how I’ve used these AI tools in RStudio, Positron, and VS Code to speed up both my advanced R workflows as well as my learning experience as an intermediate Python programmer, providing examples, pitfalls, and best practices.

### Modular, layout-as-code approach for customizable Shiny dashboards 

💬 Speaker(s): Kim Schouten

 📝 Abstract: 

To improve government supervision in the healthcare space, we have designed a Shiny dashboard that enables us to adhere to GDPR and other regulations and share different bits of information with different types of stakeholders. For that, we have implemented a ‘layout-as-code’ system where each user can have its own layout of pages and modules, stored as json in the database. Users have the option to drag and drop modules to different locations or change the layout altogether, adding and removing modules as needed! 
<br>For developers, this system of loosely coupled modules helps to quickly contribute to the project as a new module needs only a couple of lines of code to integrate it within the framework.

### Death by Dropdown? Engineer Insightful Shiny Apps with Behavioral Science

💬 Speaker(s): Jeremy Winget, PhD

 📝 Abstract: 

Opening a Shiny app to endless dropdowns and scattered filters leads to immediate disengagement and feeling like "death by dropdown". This talk introduces the Behavioral Insights Design (BID) Framework, a behavioral science roadmap that transforms overwhelming dashboards into guided user journeys. Using the "Interfaces Need A Smart Vision" mnemonic, we'll explore five stages: Interpret user needs through data storytelling, Notice cognitive friction points, Anticipate user behavior, Structure the application, and Validate & empower users. Drawing from established theories and real-world production examples, attendees will see how applying behavioral science can dramatically reduce the time between "Where do I even start?" and "Aha, now I get it!". You'll leave with practical techniques using the new {bidux} package to help transform user confusion into confident exploration and build dashboards that guide users toward better decisions (and fewer ghosted users).

### Design of Everyday Shiny Apps 

💬 Speaker(s): Casey Aguilar-Gervase; Maya Gans

 📝 Abstract: 

Donald Norman’s Design of Everyday Things shows how even smart people struggle with bad design—flipping the wrong switch, pushing a door instead of pulling. The same issues exist in Shiny apps, where function often outweighs experience. But as a Shiny developer, you are the door designer, and it’s your responsibility to create user-friendly tools. Not to worry—good design isn’t just for designers. You don’t need an art degree to build intuitive, visually appealing apps. This talk covers composition, color theory, scale, and proportion—practical rules to improve usability. We’ll show real-world examples and code-based strategies to bring these principles to life. Because good design isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.

### Can I trust that package? 

💬 Speaker(s): Colin S Gillespie

 📝 Abstract: 

We often forget, surrounded by hex stickers and bad R package puns, that not everyone is as trustworthy as us. This, I suppose, means that when IT asks, “Is this package valid, secure, and trustworthy?” it’s not that unreasonable a question. But this throws up multiple issues. There are thousands of R packages on CRAN, and that doesn’t include the R-universe, Bioconductor, and GitHub. Packages are updated all the time, so how do we keep up? More to the point what does valid, secure and trustworthy even mean? 
<br><br>
In this talk, I’ll discuss the litmusverse. A suite of packages for assessing a package risk. Importantly, it’s not one size fits all. Instead, it’s about defining your risk appetite and acting accordingly.

### R & Python playing nice, in production 

💬 Speaker(s): Claudia Penaloza

 📝 Abstract: 

Hi, I’m Claudia Peñaloza, a Data Scientist at Continental Tires, where going data-driven can be an adventure.
<br>What started as a proof of concept a few years ago, evolved into Conti’s first-ever Predictive Machine Learning Model for R&D! 
<br>A baby, a wedding, two lateral moves, and three hires later, our team had also evolved… from mostly R to mostly Python developers. 
<br>Rewriting 1000+ commits? No thanks. Instead, we got R and Python to play nice. With Renv, Poetry, and Docker, we keep things reproducible, portable, and deployable on various ML-Ops platforms.
<br>The takeaway? With the right tools, teams can mix and match languages, leveraging the best in each, and still build solid, scalable solutions.

### Zero Tolerance for Dirty Data: A Pointblank Prescription for Data Hygiene 

💬 Speaker(s): Arnav Patel

 📝 Abstract: 

Data validation is an exercise that is commonly forgotten. It can be difficult to start the exercise, let alone figure out a holistic approach to cleaning and understanding data. This is a problem that affects us all regardless of experience, expertise, or complexity of work. With Pointblank’s suite of validation functions, you can scan your data, present that scan in a visually appealing and unique report, and then define validation rules at scale in a methodical manner. I want to show why pointblank, above other validation packages, is the best validation approach through its simple yet appealing reporting features and comprehensive validation schema.

### Data-as-a-product: A framework for collaborative data wrangling 

💬 Speaker(s): Clara Amorosi

 📝 Abstract: 

Data preparation requires substantial time and subject matter expertise but is often tailored to a single-use deadline rather than encouraging reusable workflows across a team. We developed a framework that acknowledges the time and expertise invested in data preparation and maximizes its value. Our data-as-a-product suite of R packages promotes joint code and data version control, standardizes metadata capture, tracks R package versioning, and encourages best practices such as adherence to functional programming. I'm excited to share my experience onboarding collaborators to this reproducible research framework, highlighting key challenges and lessons learned from advocating for good development practices in a dynamic research environment.

### Disposable Shiny Apps 

💬 Speaker(s): James Wade

 📝 Abstract: 

Many data scientists find themselves building Shiny apps for one-off presentations, client meetings, or teaching demonstrations. These "disposable" apps can suffer from overengineering, leading to unnecessary development time and complexity. Or, the apps never get built because the development hill is too high to climb. This talk covers disposable Shiny apps - intentionally minimal applications designed for specific, short-term needs. We'll explore strategies for rapid development, including reusable templates, coding assistants, efficient styling, and design principles that prioritize speed and clarity. This talk will show how this approach can transform a typical week-long development process into a few hours while maintaining polish.

### Election Night Reporting Using R & Quarto 

💬 Speaker(s): Gabe Osterhout; Andrew Heiss

 📝 Abstract: 

Election night reporting (ENR) is often clunky, outdated, and overpriced. The Idaho Secretary of State’s office leveraged R and Quarto to create a better ENR product for the end user while driving down costs using the open-source software we all know and love. With help from Dr. Andrew Heiss, R was used in every step of the process—from {dbplyr} backend to visualizing the results using {reactable} tables and {leaflet} maps, combining the output into a visually appealing Quarto website. Quarto was the ideal solution due to its scalability, quick deployment, responsive design, and easy navigation. In addition, Dr. Heiss will discuss the advantages of using a {targets} pipeline and creating programmatic code chunks in Quarto.

### Theming Made Easy: Introducing brand.yml 

💬 Speaker(s): Garrick Aden-Buie

 📝 Abstract: 

brand.yml is an exciting new project from Posit that radically simplifies theming. Every data science tool supports some form of theme and appearance customization, but each app framework, output format, or visualization tool requires its own special syntax for theming.
<br><br>
The goal of brand.yml is to create a portable and unified interface for brand-related theming that can be used anywhere that data science artifacts are produced. As a collaboration between the Shiny and Quarto teams, brand.yml provides a single interface to setting baseline themes in reports and apps across the R and Python ecosystems.
<br><br>
In this talk, I’ll introduce brand.yml and showcase the many ways that brand.yml can bring consistent styles to your data science outputs.
