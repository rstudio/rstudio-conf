### A Future of Data Science
💬 Allen Downey

In the hype cycle of data science, I suggest that the "peak of inflated expectations" was in 2012, the "trough of disillusionment" was in 2016, and since then, we have climbed the "slope of enlightenment". Now, as we approach the "plateau of productivity", it's a good time to figure out how we got here and what future we want. Can we use data to answer questions, resolve debates, and make better decisions? What tools and processes make data science work? What can we learn when it does, and what goes wrong when it doesn't? In this talk, I will present my answers, and then I would like to hear yours.

### Creating reproducible static reports.
💬 Orla Doyle

In clinical trials we work in interdisciplinary teams where the discussion of outputs is often facilitated using static documents. We wanted to bring the advantages of modern tools (R, markdown, git) and software development practices to the production of company documents. We used an object-oriented approach to create classes for report items with a suite of tests. Finally, the report is rendered programmatically in docx format using a company template. This enables our statisticians to work in a truly end to end fashion within a GxP environment with the end product in a format suitable for interdisciplinary collaboration. We are currently piloting this package internally before we release in the open-source community.

### Data Wrangling [for Python or R] Like a Boss With DuckDB
💬 Hannes Mühleisen

Data wrangling is the thorny hedge that higher powers have placed in front of the enjoyable task of actually analyzing or visualizing data. Common struggles come from importing data from ill-mannered CSV files, the tedious task of orchestrating efficient data transformation, or the inevitable management of changes to tables. Data wrangling is rife with questionable ad-hoc solutions, which can sometimes even make things worse. The design rationale of DuckDB is to support the task of data wrangling by bringing the best of decades of data management research and best practices to the world of interactive data analysis in R or Python. For example, DuckDB has one of the world's most advanced CSV reader, native support for Parquet files and Arrow structures, an efficient parallel vectorized query processing engine, and support for efficient atomic updates to tables. All of this is wrapped up in a zero-dependency package available in a programming language near you for free. In my talk, I will discuss the above as well as the design rationale of DuckDB, which was designed and built in collaboration with the Data Science community in the first place.

### Demystifying Data Modeling
💬 Kshitij Aranke

Data Modeling – what is it, why is it useful, and how dbt makes it easy.

As a previous R user, I was very skeptical of the value of data modeling when I first came across it. But over time, I realized that it helped organizations scale up analytics practices by standardizing on consistent definitions for metrics, improving debuggability for data pipelines, and even enabling rapid experimentation. I want to share this magic with the posit::conf community, and especially how dbt is a tool that's oriented around this practice.

### Deploying data applications and documents to the cloud
💬 Alex Chisholm

Creating engaging data content has never been easier, yet easily sharing remains a challenge. And that's the point, right? You cleaned the data, wrangled it, and summarized everything for others to benefit. But where do you put that final result? If you're still using R Markdown, perhaps it's rpubs.com. If you've adopted Quarto, it could be quartopub.com. Have a Jupyter notebook? Well, that's a different service. And this is just for docs. Want to deploy a streamlit app? Head to streamlit.io. Shiny? Log into shinyapps.io. Dash? You could use ploomber.io, if you have a docker file - and know what that is. This session summarizes the landscape for online data sharing and describes a new tool that Posit is working on to simplify your process.

### Data Wrangling for Advocacy: Tidy Data to Support the Affordable Connectivity Program
💬 Christine Parker

We sought to create a dashboard to highlight some frequently asked statistics about the Affordable Connectivity Program. Although the program data were "available" to the public, they were not accessible. Wrangling messy datasets is not new to data scientists, and our work included pretty straightforward summary statistics, yet this work became a leading resource for advocacy groups, academics, policy makers, and ultimately led us to a meeting where we shared guidance about the program funding needs with the White House. While I give a shout out to a few of my favorite R packages, in this talk I focus on the strategies you can employ to make your data tool have an impact.

### Novice to data scientist: how a pediatric anesthesiologist used R Studio to help disadvantaged kids access surgical care
💬 Nick Pratap

When a surgical procedure gets cancelled, a child gains no health benefit, families' time off work and pre-op anxiety is in vain, and our not-for-profit children's hospital loses ~$1 per second. To understand cancellation, I needed to analyze thousands of patient records. Despite zero formal training, I learned to tidy then visualize data – and even do geocoding and machine learning. Once we identified children at high risk, we could target additional support to their families. Furthermore, we showed that surgery cancellation contributes to health inequality. The R Studio/tidyverse ecosystem allows novices to do sophisticated analytics, and is helping us improve access to health care for the most disadvantaged children in our communities.

### Python Rgonomics
💬 Emily Riederer

Data science languages are increasingly interoperable with advances like Arrow, Quarto, and Posit Connect. But data scientists are not. Learning the basic syntax of a new language is easy, but relearning the ergonomics that help us be hyperproductive is hard. In this talk, I will explore the influential ergonomics of R's tidyverse. Next, I will recommend a curated stack that mirrors these ergonomics while also being genuinely truly pythonic. In particular, we will explore packages (polars, seaborn objects, greattables), frameworks (Shiny, Quarto), dev tools (pyenv, ruff, and pdm), and IDEs (VS Code extensions). The audience should leave feeling inspired to try python while benefiting from their current knowledge and expertise.

### Coding in a Cyclone: open-source and the public sector in the birthplace of R
💬 Lee Durbin

When I started working at Te Kaunihera o Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland Council, I knew that R had been invented at the University of Auckland, and I knew that using R for data wrangling was a better way than using Excel. So I set about learning how to code with R, supported by the generosity of the R community and a plethora of freely-available online resources. During my journey I discovered that a mature data culture is underpinned by three components, but when I was asked to use my data skills to help out during a cyclone I realised that I was missing one of the three. In this talk I discuss how I reached that point, and what I did about it.

### Why’d you load that package for?
💬 Luis D. Verde Arregoitia

Packages enhance programming languages, and working with code makes workflows repeatable. However, the number of existing packages can be overwhelming to the point of obscuring their roles within projects. This talk discusses the importance of scripts, and introduces ways to enhance package load calls. First, by building annotations with the annotater R package and also by learning from code comments across GitHub. The value of recording information such as package source, version, title, or even which functions or data are used in a script is discussed in both data science and teaching environments.

### Datapages for interactive data sharing using Quarto
💬 Mika Braginsky

Findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data sharing is a key component of open science, but presents a challenge for researchers, especially those with limited technical expertise or resources. If datasets are shared, it's most often as static files, restricting the FAIRness of the data. We use Quarto and Observable JS to develop Datapages, tools and templates that bridge this gap. Datapages enables researchers and other data distributors to easily share versioned datasets along with interactive visualizations, rich documentation, and user-friendly access functionality.

### Using the Kyber R package to connect Google Sheets, RMarkdown, GitHub, and Agenda docs for open education
💬 Stefanie Butland

As we work in open data science spaces, we frequently peer-teach coding and collaboration skills. The setup work is often grossly underestimated and unseen. I’ll share how Openscapes automates setup with the Kyber R package that uses googlesheets4 and creates RMarkdown documents that become collaborative Google Doc agendas, and sets up repositories and organizes people on GitHub. Kyber replaces manual steps with R functions while maintaining the ability to edit outputs so we’re not constrained by the automation. It has enabled us to teach workshops repeatedly in less time – in 2022 we led 4 concurrent learning cohorts with 160 government scientists! Kyber is openly available to fork, reuse, and extend, and other groups are doing just that.

### Understanding, Generating, and Evaluating Prediction Intervals
💬 Bryan Shalloway

For many problems concerning prediction, providing intervals is more useful than just offering point estimates. This talk will provide an overview of:

- How to think about uncertainty in your predictions (e.g. noise in the data vs uncertainty in estimation)
- Approaches to producing prediction intervals (e.g. parametric vs conformal)
- Measures and considerations when evaluating and training models for prediction intervals

While I will touch on some similar topics as Max Kuhn’s posit::conf(2023) talk on conformal inference, my talk will cover different points and have a broader focus. I hope attendees gain an understanding of some of the key tools and concepts related to prediction intervals and that they leave inspired to learn more.

### Quality Control to avoid GIGO in Deep Learning Models.
💬 Vasant Marur

Deep Learning models help answer scientific questions, but they are only as accurate as the data we feed them. To ensure accurate models, we can implement quality control (QC) methods to ensure only high quality data is used in training these models. Scientists generate thousands of images as part of Image-Based High Content Screening assays. To help them quickly assess the quality of these images before considerable time is spent analyzing them, we developed an interactive tool using Shiny that displays which images were flagged as part of QC. In this talk, I’ll explain how we created this QC tool and share ideas on how you could leverage your existing code and turn it into a stand alone web app your stakeholders can use.

### Democratizing Organizational Surveys with Quarto and Shiny
💬 Brennan Antone

When gathering data from groups (e.g., surveys), where does it go, and who does it help? How can we deliver value directly back to all survey participants, not just top organizational decision-makers?

In this talk, I discuss re-designing how we report on organizational feedback surveys, moving from a top-down to a bottom-up approach to organizational change. Interactive dashboards can make data and feedback accessible to all. This tackles challenges with data quality, privacy, and power - allowing everyone to benefit directly from their data. I examine how Quarto and Shiny enable the creation of "flipped reports", and describe takeaways from implementing them with two Fortune 500 companies.

This talk teaches how personalized tools can make data accessible to all, and can alter the power dynamics around how organizations enact change.

### Getting Data Done with a Pragmatic Data Team
💬 Alan Schussman

Data work comes in lots of forms, and large organizations with reliable pipelines of similar problems can be very specialized in how they tackle this work. My contention is that many organizations doing data work don't get to be so picky: Instead of specialized roles in focused parts of a data process, many of us work from end to end, and projects often differ in the tools and domain knowledge they require. Identifying and making use of good, reusable practices in this environment is hard, and there's not a consistent supply of some of the work that's most appealing to ambitious data people. This talk explores some successes and failures in building flexible, effective, empowered teams in this environment.

### Designing and Deploying Internal Quarto Templates
💬 Meghan Hall

Quarto is a game-changer for creating reproducible, parameterized documents. But the beauty of Quarto—that it has so many different use cases with various output formats—can lead to disarray with numerous .qmd files floating around an organization and too much copy-paste when creating something new. Quarto templates are perfect for easing the burden of developing a report and instead standardizing the structure, style, and initial content of your projects, no matter the output format. We’ll discuss tips and tricks for implementing enough html and css to create beautiful documents that match your organization’s branding and also explore how easy it can be to deploy those Quarto templates with a single function within an internal R package.

In the last few months, the best LLMs have taken a big step forward in their ability to help write code. We’ve been building a tool that uses an LLM to help you learn Shiny and build Shiny applications much faster than ever before.

If you feel like you don’t have the time to invest into learning Shiny, this might change your mind. You’ll get up and running with Shiny in no time, and you’ll be able to learn from the AI as you go. If you already know Shiny, you’ll be able to dramatically accelerate your development process, and you’ll find yourself trying out new things that wouldn’t have been worth the effort before.

### Supercharge Your Shiny (for Python) App: Unleashing Jupyter Widgets for Interactivity
💬 Carson Sievert

Most Python packages that provide interactive web-based visualizations (e.g., altair, plotly, bokeh, ipyleaflet, etc.) can render in Jupyter notebooks via the ipywidgets standard. The shinywidgets package brings that ipywidgets standard to Shiny, enabling the use of 100s of Jupyter Widgets as Shiny outputs. In this talk, you'll not only learn how to render Jupyter Widgets in Shiny to get interactive output, but also how to leverage user interaction with widgets to create delightful and bespoke experiences.

### 20+ Years of Reading Data into R
💬 Colin Gillespie

For the last 20+ years, I've been reading data into R. It all started with the humble scan() function. Then, I used fancy new-fangled file formats, such as parquet and arrow, before progressing onto trendy databases, such as duckdb, for analytics. Besides the fun you can have by messing around with new technologies, when should you consider the above formats? In this talk, I'll cover a variety of methods for importing data and highlight the good, the bad, and the annoying.

### Contributing to the R Project
💬 Heather Turner

Posit provides an amazing set of products to support data science, and we will learn about many great packages and approaches from both Posit and the wider community at posit::conf(2024). But underlying it all are a number of open source tools, notably R and Python. How can we contribute to sustaining these open source projects, so that we can continue to use and build on them?

In this talk I will address this question in the context of the R project. I will give an overview of the ways we can contribute as individuals or companies/organizations, both financially and in kind. Together we can build a more sustainable future for R!

### What I learned resurrecting an R package
💬 Dave Slager

We hear a lot about creating R packages, but R packages don't last forever on their own. I describe my experience resurrecting rvertnet, an abandoned ropensci project that had become stale on CRAN. I talk about how I found out the package needed a new maintainer, how I took ownership of the package, and how I decided what needed fixing. I discuss several examples of package repairs I implemented, including fixing outdated CI, removing unnecessary files and dependencies, writing workarounds for deprecated functions, and fixing building of a vignette. Finally, I'll describe my positive experiences communicating with the old maintainer and submitting a package to CRAN for the first time.

### Building sustainable open-source ecosystems: Lessons from the #rstats community and an NSF grant.
💬 Kelly Bodwin

The blessing and the curse of open-source software is that it lacks the infrastructure of a corporation. It can often be difficult to ensure that projects have stability and longevity. In this talk, I will discuss ongoing work on an NSF "Pathways in Open-Source Ecosystems" grant focused on the {data.table} package. Like many R packages, {data.table} has incredible functionality and thousands of users - but no cohesive community or governance structure to support it long-term. We are working to build this ecosystem. I will provide my advice and insight for key aspects of a sustainable open-source project: Engaging casual users, supporting developers, generating content, emphasizing education, and creating a home base for the community.

### Deep Learning is Just LEGO: and Other Hands on Machine Learning Activities
💬 Chelsea Parlett-Pelleriti

Machine Learning involves a lot of math, and a lot of code. But it can also involve LEGO, coloring sheets, and 3D printed gradients! Hands on, kinesthetic activities help people learn complex technical concepts in an intuitive way, and to be honest, provide a welcome break from all the formulas and function definitions. These activities not only increase engagement, but make the topic more accessible to a wider range of people. Come learn how to use and design these activities for yourself, or for a class!

### Supporting Social Good Through Community-Based Data Science Education
💬 Carrie Wright

In this data-centric era, the demand for responsible data science practitioners is more crucial than ever. However many data science education programs don’t adequately emphasize data ethics. To address this need, my colleagues, Ava Hoffman, Michael Rosenblum, and I have developed a course at Johns Hopkins, offering students hands-on experiences collaborating with community-based organizations on diverse data science projects. We've partnered with organizations championing various causes, including youth leadership, voting rights, transportation advocacy, and community tool banks. We've gained valuable insights about hands-on data ethics education and demonstrated that even data science education itself can support social good.

### AI for Gaming: How I Built a Bot to Play a Video-Game with R and Python
💬 Aleksander Dietrichson

I recently undertook to build a robot to play a video game online. Using reinforcement learning, a custom computer vision model, and browser automation –all implemented in R/Python– I was able to create an AI which played the game to perfection. In this presentation I will share the lessons learned as I went through this process, and some hints to avoid the pitfalls I tackled. I will present some real-world business cases to answer the obvious why-question. For colleagues who teach Data Science and AI, I will show how an activity such as this can provide the entry-point and basis for discussion for more than half a dozen topics, ranging from formal logic, game theory, empirical inference, all the way to Shiny and Quarto.

### Creating multi-figure visualizations with Patchwork
💬 Thomas Lin Pedersen

While many visualization frameworks focus on facilitating the creation of a single plot, combining multiple plots into a single coherent figure is often the end goal when creating a visualization. There is no shortage of packages in R for doing this but they often lack in flexibility or are cumbersome to use. Because of this, the patchwork package has become the tool of choice for many, with it's clear API and flexible customizations. This talk will guide the audience through the core concepts of the patchwork package, starting with simple compositional tasks and moving all the way up to advanced nested layouts and insets, preparing them to use the package in their day-to-day work when they come home.

### tidymodels for time-to-event data
💬 Hannah Frick

Time-to-event data can show up in a broad variety of contexts: the event may be a customer churning, a machine needing repairs or replacement, a pet being adopted, or a complaint being dealt with. Survival analysis is methodology which allows you to model both aspects, the time and the event status, at the same time. tidymodels now provides support for this kind of data across the framework.

### Evaluating Time-to-Event Models is Hard
💬 Max Kuhn

Censoring in data can frequently occur when we have a time-to-event. For example, if we order a pizza that has not yet arrived after 5 minutes, it is censored; we don't know the final delivery time, but we know it is at least 5 minutes. Censored values can appear in clinical trials, customer churn analysis, pet adoption statistics, or anywhere a duration of time is used. I'll describe different ways to assess models for censored data and focus on metrics requiring an evaluation time (i.e., how well does the model work at 5 minutes?). I'll also describe how you can use tidymodel's expanded features for these data to tell if your model fits the data well.This talk is designed to be paired with the other tidymodels talk by Hannah Frick.

### Tidypredict with recipes, turn workflow to SQL, spark, duckdb and beyond
💬 Emil Hvitfeldt

Tidypredict is one of my favorite packages. Being able to turn a fitted model object into an equation is very powerful! However in tidymodels, we use recipes more and more to do preprocessing. So far, tidypredict didn’t have support for recipes, which severely limited its uses. This talk is about how I fixed that issue. Spending a couple of years thinking about this problem, I finally found a way! Being able to turn a tidymodels workflow into a series of equations for prediction is super powerful. For some uses, being able to turn a model to predict inside SQL, spark or duckdb allows us to handle some problems with more ease.
