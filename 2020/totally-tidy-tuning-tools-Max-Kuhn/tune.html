But how do we know that `penalty` = 0.1, `mixture` = 0.5, and 5 degree of freedom splines are what we should use?

These are tuning parameters. 

The `tune` package can be used to find good values for these parameters.

How can we alter these objects to "tag" which arguments should be tuned?

Kind of looks like the `rsample` objects with some extra list columns.

We have a bunch of high-level functions that will work with these objects.

# Plot Method Shows the Marginal Relationships


```r
# This will improve. Maybe a `shinytune` package? 
autoplot(grid_res, metric = "rsq")
```

# Miscellaneous Notes

* The default grid is a _space filling design_.

* We capture all warnings and errors and store them on the `.notes` column.

* You can save the predictions, fitted models/recipes with additional options.

* The results using `verbose = TRUE` are 💯.

* `foreach` is used to standard **parallel processing** tools can be used. 

* You can alter the grid, performance metrics, and other aspects.

* `tune` works well with our new `workflows` package.

# Fini

`tune` is _almost_ on CRAN. For now:

```r
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/tune")
```

A good place to learn: [`https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/`](https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/)

We are working on a `tidymodels` book (coming soon!) that will discuss this thoroughly.
