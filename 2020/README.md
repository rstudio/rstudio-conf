<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Recent progress in machine learning has raised a series of urgent questions: How can we train and debug deep learning models? How can we understand what is going on inside a neural network? And, perhaps most important, how can we design systems that serve people best? We'll show a series of examples from the People+AI Research (PAIR) initiative at Google--ranging from data visualizations for researchers, to tools for medical practitioners, to guidelines for designers--that illustrate how thinking carefully about data can lead to better tools, more effective design, and help humans and AI work together.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>
	
### 1130 Session 1, Case Study	


**Case Studies in Customer Success**

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">The path to becoming a world-class, data-driven organization is daunting. The challenges you will likely face along the way can be thorny, and in some cases, seem outright impossible to overcome. How do you get teams that traditionally butt heads, such as IT and data science, to complement each other and work in unison? How can you efficiently scale the scope and reach of your data products as requirements change? Your time should be spent doing truly valuable work instead of updating charts and reports. How do you prevent the support structure behind your platform from toppling like a house of cards? Despite these challenges, we think that the end result is worth it: an organization that is equipped to make important decisions, with confidence, using data analysis that comes from a sustainable environment. We see this outcome every day.</span></p></div></div></p></details><br>


**How Vibrant Emotional Health Connected Siloed Data Sources and Streamlined Reporting Using R**
<br>by Sean Murphy
<br>Materials:

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Vibrant Emotional Health is the mental health not-for-profit behind the US National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, New York City's NYC Well program, and various other emotional health contact center programs and direct services. We engage in emotionally charged conversations with people experiencing a wide variety of mental health and emotional concerns, our programs vary in scope, in resources, and span several technologies. In addition, our data collection and reporting requirements change dynamically in response to emerging clinical needs and reporting requirements from our sponsors. In short, the data we collect is complex, often unstructured, and stored in a variety of sources. In this context, R Markdown Documents have allowed us to interface directly with multiple databases, Google Sheets, API's, csv's, and JSON stores to generate integrated reports. Organizing these reports into R packages with accompanying functions that standardize the calculation of KPI's and apply consistent themes across analyses has allowed us to improve the clarity and aesthetics of our reporting while reducing manual work that was previously needed to produce these reports. Building on this framework we have developed functions to standardize data connections, create reusable data visualizations, and generate reproducible analyses in response to ad hoc analytic requests. These same functions also facilitate the creation of Shiny dashboards where core visualizations that were previously only available in static reports can be manipulated directly by end users to explore clinical and operational trends. These dashboards also facilitate self service reporting by end users. We present here the framework we have developed for our organization wide and program specific packages, the types of functions and artifacts they include and our plans for future development.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">We have recently implemented a new Data Science workflow and pipeline, using RStudio Connect and Google Cloud Services. This has vastly decreased our pipeline complexity, allowing us to bring our models and products into scheduled production more quickly. In addition, our workflow, working closely together as a team on all projects on a regular two-week sprint cycle, has increased the range of projects we have been able to take on and complete. To detail some of the key lessons we’ve learned (and some of the difficulties!), we’ll walk you through one of our recent sprints, where we productionalised the generation of a suite of behavioural and demographic features so that they can be more easily plugged in to a range of models and used across the business by the FT’s platform and product teams.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>


**How to win an AI Hackathon, without using AI**

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Anyone reading a newspaper or listening to the news is led to believe that AI is the solution to all problems. From self-driving cars to detecting disease to catching fraud, there doesn’t seem to be a situation that AI can’t tackle. Once “big data” is thrown into the mix, the AI solution is all but certain. But is AI always needed? Over the last eighteen months, Jumping Rivers has entered (and won) four Hackathons. All Hackathons were characterised with “big data” and the need to improve prediction. All Hackathons were won without using AI (or any sort of machine learning). This talk will focus on one particular competition around reducing leakage at Northumbrian Water. Using a combination of R, Shiny, and tidyverse (and a few other tricks), we were able to demonstrate within the short Hackathon time frame that clear presentation of data to the front line engineers was more likely to reduce leakage, than simply providing vague estimates of a potential future leak</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>
	
### 1130 Session 1, Education	


**Meet You Where You R**
<br>by Lauren Chadwick
<br>Materials:

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">At RStudio, we wake up and go to bed thinking about the positive impact that open source work and data science has had and can have on the world. To maximize this impact, we find three areas of investment absolutely critical to ensure our open source community keeps up with the world’s changes and outlives us all: 1. Find ways to make R more approachable. 2. Enable teams of all types &amp; sizes (educational, professional, etc.) to be able to leverage the work they’re doing in R, and effortlessly communicate that work to others. 3. Extend the language so our open-source community can continue to be at the forefront of innovation, no matter their preference of tool or language. Underpinning these investments is also the core belief that every data scientist, regardless of skill level, use-case, or professional experience, is an asset to our community. Whether you’re a student currently learning R, a Python fan looking to become multilingual, or the Head of Data Science at NASA, we want you to become a part of our journey. In return, we’ll do our best to ensure that journey is a fulfilling endeavor. This presentation will take a deeper dive into the ways in which you can utilize RStudio's educational offerings and enterprise toolchain in personal, educational, and corporate settings. educational offerings and enterprise toolchain in personal, educational, and corporate settings.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">More people are learning data science every day, and there are more ways for them to learn than ever before. To understand where we are and where we might be going, this talk looks at what data science education could look like two years from now: far enough away that we can dream, but close enough that we can only dream a little. We explore the balance between automated and collaborative learning, different ways to deliver different kinds of lessons to different kinds of people, and ways in which our tools and practices could improve.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

How do you make it engaging so they sit and stay a while? How do you make it memorable so they come back to visit again? In this talk, I’ll share lessons learned from my experience of making a series of online statistics modules (co-authored by Hasse Walum) that feel accessible and fun-- housed entirely in an R Markdown site, complete with a whimsical, illustrated narrative about teacup giraffes. I’ll show how adding good characters with your audience in mind, good design, and good play helped me make the most of HTML output. To help you get started, I’ll share resources that Alison Hill and I have developed--including a series of cookbooks and out-of-the-box templates-- so that you will have a leg up on applying these ideas to R Markdown collections of your own.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Salesforce is not only a cloud software solution out of the box, but also a highly customizable platform that can be modified for a wide range of use cases. In addition to complexity, customer trust is our #1 company value and customer data privacy is abstracted from everyone outside of the customer. Product and Growth Analytics is an emerging field separate from business analytics and data science and focuses on building software product that improve user retention and engagement. Companies like Facebook and AirBnB have robust data science teams focused on product analytics. At Salesforce however, given the scale, customization, and privacy values, product data science is not so straightforward. Utilizing R and Rstudio tools for collaboration and reproducible analytics, the Data Intelligence team is able to solve complex problems at enterprise scale. This talk will preview anonymized predictive and growth analytics work while also highlighting how we work and collaborate cross platform and languages (Python via reticulate).</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

**Simplified Data Quality Monitoring of Dynamic Longitudinal Data: A Functional Programming Approach**
<br>by Jacqueline Gutman
<br>Materials:
<br>🎥:
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Ensuring the quality of data we deliver to customers or provide as inputs to models is often one of the most under-appreciated and yet time-consuming responsibilities of a modern data scientist. This task is challenging enough when working with static data, but when we have access to dynamic, longitudinal, continuously updating data, that complexity can become an asset. We will demonstrate how to to simplify data quality monitoring of dynamic data with a functional programming approach that enables early and actionable detection of data quality concerns.   Using purrr as well as tidyr and nested tibbles, we will illustrate the five key pillars of enjoyable, user-friendly data quality monitoring with relevant R code: Readability, Reproducibility, Efficiency, Robustness, and Compositionality.   Readability: FP empowers us to abstract away from the mechanics and implementation of comparing two or more related datasets and move towards declaring the intent of features and metrics we want to compare.   Reproducibility: By avoiding side-effects and dependencies on external states and inputs, and using functional units which can be easily tested over a variety of inputs, FP reduces the burden to create reproducible code. Perhaps more importantly, FP supports not just reproducibility of results, but reproducibility of workflows that can be continually applied to dynamic datasets.  Efficiency: FP enables more efficient code through lazy evaluation, caching, and simplifying implementation over parallel backends.  Robustness: FP allows greater testability of our code through modularization and elegant error-handling, with customized fail-safes for data that differs in expected ways over time.   Compositionality: FP encourages higher-level reasoning with functions, which in turn drives both readability--through higher-level, more abstract code--and robustness, through modifying function behavior in case errors are encountered.</p></details><br>


**vctrs: Creating custom vector classes with the vctrs package**
<br>by Jesse Sadler
<br>Materials:
<br>🎥:
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">The base R types of vectors enable the representation of an amazingly wide array of data types. There is so much you can do with R. However, there may be times when your data does not fit into one of the base types and/or you want to add metadata to vectors. vctrs is a developer-focused package that provides a clear path for creating your own S3-vector class, while ensuring that the classes you build integrate into user expectations for how vectors work in R. This presentation will discuss the why and how of using vctrs through the example of debkeepr, a package for integrating historical non-decimal currencies such as pounds, shillings, and pence into R. The presentation will provide a step-by-step process for developing various types of vectors and thinking through the design process of how vectors of different classes should work together.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>


**Asynchronous programming in R**
<br>by Winston Chang
<br>Materials:
<br>🎥:
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block"">Writing regular R code is straightforward: you tell R to do something, it does it, and then it returns control back to you. This is called synchronous programming. However, if you use R to coordinate threads, processes, or network communication, the regular model may be unable to do what you want, or it may only be able to do it with a significant performance penalty. In this talk I'll explain how <span style=""font-style: italic;"">asynchronous</span> programming with the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">later</span> package can handle these kinds of programming problems. I'll also show how to provide a synchronous interface for asynchronous code, so that users will have a simple, familiar way to use your code.</p> </div></div></p></details><br>


**Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions**
<br>by Jim Hester
<br>Materials:
<br>🎥:
<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Open source R packages on GitHub often take advantage of continuous integration services to automatically check their packages for errors. This is very useful to catch things quickly, as well and increasing confidence for proposed changes, as the Pull Requests can be checked before they are merged. Travis-CI and Appveyor are the most popular current methods. However newer services, Azure Pipelines and GitHub Actions, show promise for being more powerful and simpler to configure and debug. I will discuss these services and demonstrate some of their capabilities and how to configure them for your own use in packages and reports.</p></details><br>
	
	
### 1415 Session 2, Community

**If you build it, they will come...but then what? Facilitating communities of practice in R**

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Why did you learn R? Chances are good that if you're an attendee of rstudio::conf, you've found a community of R coders who are willing to share their knowledge and learn with you. While it's possible to develop expert R coding skills in isolation, most software development and data analysis projects benefit from groups of people working collaboratively, and R communities are unparalleled in their inclusivity and commitment to learning collectively. Such communities, whether they support R coders at a single institution, geographic region, or online, require deliberate planning and effort to develop and sustain. How do you create a group culture that encompasses R users of various skill levels who may be working on diverse problems? How do you assess what members of a community need or prefer? How do you encourage investment and cohesion so the group will sustain itself? This talk will describe potential pitfalls and impediments to creating and facilitating cooperative learning communities for R coding, and will allow you to identify potential strategies for overcoming these challenges so you can continue giving back to the R communities that supported you along the way.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Geospatial analysts work in a wide range of positions within almost every industry. They work in government, non-profit, academic, and private institutions using geospatial data and technology to answer questions about the environment, agriculture, climate, urban planning and design, marketing, public health, transportation, and myriad other topics. A typical day may include data prep/cleaning, field work, cartography, image analysis, vector analysis, feature engineering, modeling, or database management. This diverse group necessarily uses a diverse set of tools. In this talk, we will explore how R fits into the spatial analyst’s toolkit. What does the geo community think of R? Who uses it? What groups avoid it? What geo-packages are used most? How can we, as a community, make R more appealing for geospatial scientists?</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">China has been experiencing rapid growth over the last decade due to economically friendly reforms and a growing skilled and young population. With this increasing growth, China’s interconnectedness with the global economy has increased significantly. In parallel to this economic evolution, technology has experienced rapid acceleration, which has enabled firms and governments to track and record vast amounts of data. The side effect of this unstructured big data growth is that datasets may be polluted, meaning information can be conflicting, missing, and/or unreliable. This creates a gap in the ability to provide transparency to the exposed firms importing from China: both timely early warning signals and wide coverage of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We have been able to address this problem for our end-users by using deep learning to extract information value and opinion from a public corpus to create the needed transparency. Our data science &amp; machine learning stack uses connect, shiny, reticulate, tensorflow and scikit-learn to build the interactive solution to our clients and deploy it using spark and airflow.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

As energy trading professionals working in the industry, we had developed insights around how to make risk/reward market calls, and what skills make someone an exceptional commodities trader. Traders are one of the most expensive seats in terms of monetizing value from the assets. We developed rpanda as a simulated environment which replicates closely how real-life physical commodities trading works in order to assist talent development and selection, both in academics and enterprise. My co-founder and I did not know how to design production-ready software, but we always had used R/Shiny for market analysis in our corporate jobs. Rather than hiring expensive app developers, we decided to do it ourselves. We used Rstudio development stack such as Rstudio Connect and open source tools, like plumber to turn our idea into a production-ready app that is used by University of Alberta classes. In this presentation, we share our journey, technical challenges, and how we overcame them.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Shiny is an amazing tool when it comes to creating web applications with R. Almost anybody can get a small Shiny App in a matter of minutes, provided they have a basic knowledge of R. As of today, we can safely tell that it has become the de-facto tool for web application in the R world. Building a proof-of-concept application is easy, but things change when the application becomes larger and more complex, and especially when it comes to sending that app to production—until recently there hasn't been any real framework for building and deploying production-grade Shiny Apps. This is where 'golem' comes into play: offering Shiny developers an opinionated framework for creating production-ready Shiny Applications. With 'golem', Shiny developers now have a toolkit for making a stable, easy-to-maintain, and robust for production web application with R. 'golem' has been developed to abstract away the most common engineering tasks (for example, module creation, addition of external CSS or JavaScript file, ...), so you can focus on what matters: building the application. And once your application is ready to be deployed, 'golem' guides you through testing, and brings you tools for deploying to common platforms. In this talk, Colin and Vincent will present the 'golem' package, first talking about the ""why 'golem'?"", then presenting the general philosophy behind this framework, and help you get started building your first Shiny App with 'golem'.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p>Shiny makes it easy to take domain logic from an existing R script and wrap some reactive logic around it to produce an interactive webpage where others can quickly explore different variables, parameter values, models/algorithms, etc. Although the interactivity is great for many reasons, once an interesting result is found, it’s more difficult to prove the correctness of the result since: (1) the result can only be (easily) reproduced via the Shiny app and (2) the relevant domain logic which produced the result is obscured by Shiny’s reactive logic. The R package shinymeta provides tools for capturing and exporting domain logic for execution outside of a Shiny runtime (so that others can reproduce Shiny-based result(s) from a new R session).</p></details><br>

Using tracking data, each route can be described as a sequence of spatial-temporal measurements that varies in length depending on the duration of the play. This data can be conveniently analyzed using nested columns in tidyr and purrr. We demonstrate how model-based curve clustering using Bernstein polynomial basis functions (i.e. Bézier curves) fit using the Expectation Maximization algorithm can cluster route trajectories. Each cluster can then be labelled to obtain route names for each route and create route trees for all receivers. The clusters and routes can be visualized nicely using ggplot and seen developing over time using gganimate.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">There are two main challenges of working with longitudinal (panel) data: 1) Visualising the data, and 2) Understanding the model. Visualising longitudinal data is challenging as you often get a ""spaghetti plot”, where a line is drawn for each individual. When overlaid in one plot, it can have the appearance of a bowl of spaghetti. With even a small number of subjects, these plots are too overloaded to be read easily. For similar reasons, it is difficult to relate the model predictions back to the individual and keep the context of what the model means for the individual. For both visualisation, and modelling, it is challenging to capture interesting or unusual individuals, which are often lost in the noise. Better tools, and a more diverse set of grammar and verbs are needed to visualise and understand longitudinal data and models, to capture the individual experiences. In this talk, I introduce the R package, **brolgar** (BRowse over Longitudinal data Graphically and Analytically in R), which provides new tools, verbs, and grammar to identify and summarise interesting individual patterns in longitudinal data. This package extends upon ggplot2 with custom facets, and the new tidyverts time series packages to efficiently explore longitudinal data.</span></p></div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Good examples facilitate accomplishing new or unpracticed tasks in a programmatic workflow. Tools for communicating examples have improved in recent years. Especially embraced are tools that show code and its resultant output immediately thereafter --- the case of `Jupytr` notebooks and `Rmarkdown` documents. But creators using these tools often must choose between big-picture or narrow-focus demonstration; creators tend to either demo a complete code pipeline that accomplishes a realistic task or instead demonstrate a minimal example which makes clear the behavior of a particular function, but how it might be used in a larger project isn't clear. Flipbooks help address this problem, allowing the creator to present a full demonstration which accomplishes a real task, and gives the viewer the opportunity to focus on unfamiliar steps. A set of flipbook building functions parse code in a data manipulation or visualization pipeline and then build it back up incrementally. Aligned superimposition of new code and output atop previous code and output makes it easy to identify how each code change triggers changes in output. The presentation will guide attendees in creating their own Flipbooks (with Xaringan slides) or mini Flipbooks (gif output).</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

While motivations are many and varied the two most prominent are data analysis and data collection. The R programming language is well placed to address the first need, but there are fewer options for programming behavioural experiments within the R ecosystem. The simplest experimental designs can be recast as surveys, for which there are many options, but studies in cognitive psychology, psychophysics or developmental psychology typically require more flexibility. In this talk I outline the design principles behind xprmntr, an R package that provides wrappers to the a javascript library (jsPsych) for constructing web based psychology experiments and uses the plumber package to call server side R code as needed.

**R for Graphical Clinical Trial Reporting**

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>For clinical trials a good deal of effort goes into producing both final trial reports and interim reports for data monitoring committees, and experience has shown that reviewers much prefer graphical to tabular reports. Interactive graphical reports go a step further and allow the most important information to be presented by default, while inviting the reviewer to drill down to see other details. The drill-down capability, implemented by hover text using the R plotly package, allows one to almost entirely dispense with tables because the hover text can contain the part of a table that pertains to the reviewer's current focal point in the graphical display, among other things. Also, there are major efficiency gains by having a high-level language for producing common elements of reports related to accrual, exclusions, descriptive statistics, adverse events, time to event, and longitudinal data. This talk will overview the hreport package, which relies on R, RMarkdown, knitr, plotly, Hmisc, and HTML5.  RStudio is an ideal report development environment for using these tools.</p></details><br>

Housed within Fred Hutch, SCHARP is an instrumental partner in the research and clinical trials surrounding HIV prevention and vaccine development. Part of SCHARP’s work involves analyzing experimental biomarkers and endpoints which change as the experimental question, analysis methods, antigens measured, and assays evolve. Maintaining a validated code base that is rigid in its output format, but flexible enough to cater a variety of inputs with minimal custom coding has proven to be important for reproducibility and scalability. SCHARP has developed several key steps in the creation, validation, and documentation of R packages that take advantage of R’s packaging functionality. First, the programming team works with leadership to define specifications and lay out a roadmap of the package at the functional level. Next, statistical programmers work together to develop the package, taking advantage of the rich R ecosystem of packages for development such as roxygen2, devtools, usethis, and testthat. Once the code has been developed, the package is validated to ensure it passes all specifications using a combination of testthat and rmarkdown. Finally, the package is made available for use across the team on live data. These procedures set up a framework for validating assay processing packages that furthers the ability of Fred Hutch to provide world-class support for our clinical trials.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

However, the scale and complexity of EHR data pose major challenges in deriving fit-for-purpose insights systematically and efficiently. The conventional approach, where siloed programmers write (or copy and paste) thousands of lines of undocumented, untested, unconnected SAS and SQL code for every research project is bad for business and ultimately for patients. Our team threw out the conventional approach and turned to R and the tidyverse. The result is FlatironKitchen, a modern R package enabling end-to-end EHR analyses in a cohesive, user-centric platform. FlatironKitchen allows users to “pipe their way” from database connections, to calculating derived variables, to running statistical analyses, to creating stunning visualisations. All of the technical details are both fully documented and seamlessly automised allowing users to focus on only meaningful functions that are fit-for-purpose to EHR analyses. The result: FlatironKitchen code is so simple it actually tells a step-by-step, human readable story about what the data scientist is doing-- a far cry from the Frankensteinian SQL/SAS code from the past. FlatironKitchen represents the best of both worlds in pharmaceutical data science. It gives expert data scientists a library of unit-tested, customisable functions for implementing existing procedures and designing new ones. Simultaneously, it enables those who are ‘coding insecure’ to -- finally -- work directly with data by reducing barriers. FlatironKitchen’s simple, easy-to-use syntax, combined with its training library of tutorials, vignettes and lessons made possible through RMarkdown has shown itself to be truly empowering. In addition to showcasing FlatironKitchen, we share lessons learned, and give a call to action for other pharma companies to embrace R.</p> </div></div></p></details><br>

These intricate reports require 36 hours of an engineer’s time on average, constraining the engineers from completing investigations and studies in a timely matter. Writing scripts in R that create reproducible reports can significantly reduce the time spent by an engineer creating these reports allowing them to do a much thorough investigation with a larger scope. Through Shiny, engineers could conveniently have their parameters and recorded data processed and stored in a database by accessing a web link and filling out the required information within a user-friendly interface. Upon the generation of the report, accurate and properly formatted test reports, compliant to both the company and FDA regulatory standards, are produced through Rmarkdown and knitr knitting all the outputs with complete data analysis tools such as normality plots and process capability measurements to a word document that follows company required headers, footers, and headings. The reproducible report creation shown in this report can be extended to other types of test reports and protocols. The pilot phase that has been conducted has shown that complete report production has been decreased from 36 hours to an hour.</span></p></div></div></p></details><br>

Even though R has excellent support for testing, documentation and packaging code it has the reputation that it is not suitable for production applications because data scientists don’t pay enough attention to technical debt within their codebases. Most people think of technical debt as an engineering problem. We choose to make our current work cheaper at the expense of needing to do more work down the road. But when you look closely at the root causes of technical debt they are almost always about interpersonal relationships. Developers have trouble empathizing with other users of their code and so don’t spend the time to make that code easy for future developers to use and understand. In this talk I argue that we should think about technical debt as a social problem because it gives us insight into why it’s so hard to pay back. I then provide a practical roadmap of how to introduce best practices into your data science team.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Congratulations, if there was any lingering doubt, you now know that you are officially programming! Programming involves considerably more troubleshooting and debugging than many of us expected (or signed up for). The ability to solve your own problems is an incredibly powerful stealth skill that is worth cultivating with intention. This talk will help you nurture your inner problem solver, covering both general debugging methods and specific ways to implement them in the R ecosystem.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">The creation of research reports and manuscripts is a critical aspect of the work conducted by organizations and individual researchers. Most often, this process involves copying and pasting output from many different analyses into a separate document. Especially in organizations that produce annual reports for repeated analyses, this process can also involve applying incremental updates to annual reports. It is important to ensure that all relevant tables, figures, and numbers within the text are updated appropriately. Done manually, these processes are often error prone and inefficient. R Markdown is ideally suited to support these tasks. With R Markdown, users are able to conduct analyses directly in the document or read in output from a separate analyses pipeline. Tables, figures, and in-line results can then be dynamically populated and automatically numbered to ensure that everything is correctly updated when new data is provided. Additionally, the appearance of documents rendered with R Markdown can be customized to meet specific branding and formatting requirements of organizations and journals. In this presentation, we will present one implementation of customized R Markdown reports used for Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems (ATLAS) at the University of Kansas. A publicly available R package, ratlas, provides both Microsoft Word and LaTeX templates for different types of projects at ATLAS with their own unique formatting requirements. We will discuss how to create brand-specific templates, as well as how to incorporate the templates into an R package that can be used to unify report creation across an organization. We will also describe other components of branding reports beyond R Markdown templates, including customized ggplot2 themes, which can also be wrapped into the R package. Finally, we will share lessons learned from incorporating the R package workflow into an existing reporting pipeline.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">If you’re responsible for analyses that need updating or repeating on a semi-regular basis, you might find yourself doing the same work over and over again. The principle of ""don’t repeat yourself"" from software engineering motivates us to use functions and packages, the core of repetition in the R universe. For analyses, it can be difficult to know how to use this principle and move beyond ""copying and pasting scripts and changing the data file and the object names and updating the dates and results in RMarkdown"", especially when there’s some element of human intervention required, whether it be for validating assumptions or cleaning artisanal data.
 This talk will focus on those next steps, showcasing opportunities to stop repeating yourself and instead anticipate the needs of and communicate effectively with your future self (or the next person with your job!) using project-oriented workflows, clever interactivity, templated analyses, functions, and yes, your own packages.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

With this simple format, you can actually do a lot of things. For example, you can generate reports dynamically (no need to cut-and-paste any results because all results can be dynamically generated from R), write papers and books, create websites, and make presentations. In this talk, I'll use a single R Markdown document to give demos of the R packages rmarkdown, bookdown for authoring books (https://bookdown.org), blogdown for creating websites (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), rticles for writing journal papers (https://github.com/rstudio/rticles), xaringan for making slides (https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), flexdashboard for generating dashboards (https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard), learnr for tutorials (https://github.com/rstudio/learnr), rolldown for storytelling (https://github.com/yihui/rolldown), and the integration between Shiny and R Markdown.

These models are implemented in R, exposed through APIs, and called from a cloud-based web application. The core of our pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulation functionality is available open source at `github.com/InsightRX/PKPDsim` and `github.com/InsightRX/clinPK`. As a regulated device in Europe (and soon to be in the US) used in over 100 hospitals, the platform is necessarily developed under ""design control"", meaning that strict product planning and engineering practices are required. This has implications for how the application and APIs are developed and deployed, such as strict version control workflows and implementation of rigorous testing procedures. To meet the requirements for high availability and horizontal scaling, we use a combination of Plumber and OpenCPU, hosted on RStudio Connect and AWS Fargate/ECS, which cater to the various needs of the development and production environments.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>


**Development of a web-based clinical decision support application for platelet transfusion management**

Platelets (blood cells that initiate clotting) are a rare and expensive blood product with a short shelf life. Proper management of platelet transfusions is essential to clinical care, particularly for patients who have developed antibodies against specific platelet types due to pregnancy or past transfusions. By providing platelets that avoid a patient’s known antibodies, improved patient outcomes and better inventory management of a rare blood product are achieved. To address this need, we used R, Tidyverse, and several key packages (Shiny, shinydashboard, dplyr, purrr, httr, officer, flextables, futures) to develop a web-based application (PLTVXM) to help guide platelet inventory selection. PLTVXM queries information on available/pending platelet inventory (and eligible donors) from reports that run in our institutional reporting tool Tableau® via a Tableau Server REST API. Patient antibody and blood type information is securely retrieved from a clinical data lake via an in-house R package (“dart”) and a custom institutional API. The retrieved data is processed by a published algorithm implemented in R and incorporates user input to present sortable tables of patient-specific compatible platelet inventory (and donors) for consideration. The requisite documentation for platelet product reservation or donor recruitment is then autogenerated using institutional form templates. PLTVXM is deployed on an RStudio Connect server which allows seamless integration with our institution’s Active Directory identity management infrastructure. The pilot version of PLTVXM was created by physicians without formal computer programming training in two weeks. After successful demonstration, PLTVXM was approved for clinical validation and future use in our practice. Our experience highlights how R can facilitate creation of dynamic web-based applications for a wide range of business (or clinical) needs.</p> </div></div></p></details><br>


**Forecasting Platelet Blood Bag Demand to Reduce Inventory Wastage at the Stanford Blood Center**

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">The Stanford Blood Center collects and distributes blood products to Stanford Hospital. One of these is platelets, a vital clot-forming blood component with a limited shelf life of a few days. Previous work (Guan et al. , 2017) formulated an optimization problem using features aggregated from the available data to solve the problem of reducing waste. An R package was created for a three-day ordering strategy but has not been put into production due to lack of human trust in modelling accuracy. In summer 2019, the Stanford Data Science for Social Good team, decided to make use of additional patient-level data and models to predict platelet consumption rather than relying solely on aggregated data. Modeling the transfusion recipients into different subpopulations allows for finer-grained predictions on a patient level. We make extensive use of R packages, such as the tidyverse and R Shiny, to conduct exploratory data analysis, build models, and create a user-intuitive dashboard. The Shiny dashboard is designed to display consumption predictions aggregated across all models, consumption predictions for each subpopulation, and historical performance of the model, thereby serving as a valuable tool in building the trust necessary for adopting the algorithmic ordering strategies.

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are a treasure trove of information, but tend to fall disappointingly short when it comes to visualizing and reporting data in a user friendly and intuitive manner. Building reports in an EMR can be a frustrating experience; the developer is at the mercy of how the data is stored within the EMR and the available EMR reporting tools can be bland and uninspiring. But reporting on data in the EMR doesn't have to be this way! Combining the data-rich EMR with R's robust reporting capabilities benefits both developers and consumers of data. This talk will describe how a cross-departmental project team uses an internal R package, RMarkdown reports scheduled via R Studio Connect, and an interactive flexdashboard app to quickly implement solutions to gaps in the reporting capabilities of the EMR. The flexibility of R relative to EMR reporting tools facilitates a design thinking approach to reporting allowing for more user input, customization and quick iteration. Furthermore, the web-based app we developed is able to be embedded within the EMR itself allowing for a more streamlined workflow.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

I myself produced many ugly charts during my years as a research scientist, when the design process basically came down to random tweaking until things ""looked good"". If only I could go back and tell young inexperienced me that there was a better way. In this talk, I will present that better way--a series of design principles that can take any chart from drab to fab. Rather than applying these techniques willy nilly, I will show how they form a layered ""Glamour of Graphics"" that is structured and can be easily applied to any chart. This Glamour of Graphics has some simple implementations in ggplot, where we will replace geoms, aesthetics, and scales with typography, color, and layout. Finally, I will discuss why looks matter when it comes to charts, and how by following the Glamour of Graphics you can design charts that are more persuasive and more accurately perceived.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Using ggplot2 in a package or Shiny app environment adds several constraints which are sometimes circumvented using ggplot2 behaviour that may change in the future. Some best practices include (1) using the `.data` pronoun to refer to the layer data within `aes()` and `vars()` instead of the original variable name, (2) ensuring that `plot()` methods that use ggplot2 explicitly `print()` one or more ggplot objects, (3) defining extension themes that modify a complete theme within ggplot2 (like `theme_gray()`), and (4) testing graphical output using the vdiffr package. Collectively, these practices result in better error messages with unexpected user input and ensure compatibility with most versions of ggplot2, including those to come in the future.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

The result of this experiment is the SBMR package: a native R package written to fit and investigate the results of Bipartite Stochastic Block Models that forms the backbone of my PhD dissertation. By going over the ups and downs of this process, I hope to leave the audience with inspiration for moving the package writing process closer to the start of their projects and melding research and code more closely to improve both.</span></span></p></div></div></p></details><br>

This talk will focus on how we use R to develop reference implementations of visualizations (using ggplot2), and to develop corporate-themed color maps (using the colorspace package) to bring value to the entire institution. Color maps can be translated into variety of formats, for Tableau, Qlik Sense, d3, etc., and deployed independently from R. For visualizations, our goal is to translate ggplot2 objects to Vega-Lite specifications, using a package we are developing: ggvega. Vega-Lite visualizations are web-native, and are rendered independently from R. Specifications can be designed to be extensible to new data, allowing them serve as templates, to be deployed and updated for use outside of R. Of course, despite isolation within an institution, our work with the larger R open-source communities provides a foundation on which to build; in fact, we have a lot of company and are having a lot of fun.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Seeking a unicorn is viewed as a potential indicator that the company fails to understand their data science needs, and that new hires will not be poised for success due to lacking support and resources [Robinson &amp; Nolis, 2019]. The R language, particularly when used with RStudio products, has evolved to enable production-level activities in the areas of data wrangling, reporting/dashboarding, database/software engineering, machine learning, and web application development. It is increasingly plausible that a data scientist will be able to efficiently perform a wide variety of job functions with experience only in a single language (R). Indeed, even entry level R users may tread into ""unicorn"" territory. Current standards for data scientist job descriptions and salaries do not accommodate this nuance, leaving both job-seekers and hiring managers unable to distinguish job requirements which should be read as warning signs from listings which are idyllic matches for the modern R unicorn. In this talk, we present data aggregated from several large compensation analytics companies which summarize current benchmarks for data science job descriptions and corresponding salary ranges. We then suggest job description language to target modern R users, considering both job duty compatibility and job post findability. These descriptions are presented with likely salary range pairings. Attention is given to deviations from traditional degree requirements, years of experience, and demands for multiple programming language literacy which may lack relevance for the R unicorn. Our overarching goal is to provide job description templates which encourage optimal matchmaking between R job seekers and organizations in need of their talents.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

While the concrete examples in this talk will mostly come from the **manufacturing** space, where I have the most experience, I believe the themes are relevant to many meatspace workflows. We'll talk through effective playbooks that can help you navigate common tasks throughout the life-cycle of a project. We’ll also weave in how R’s glorious package ecosystem, including `tidyverse`, can be combined with other languages like `python`, and with enterprise products like **RStudio Connect** to great effect.

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Vega-lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics implemented in Javascript; it renders interactive visualizations in the browser based on a JSON specification. In Python and Javascript, the Altair and vega-lite-api packages have demonstrated how the development of APIs to build Vega-Lite graphics can be partially automated based on the Vega-Lite JSON schema, which describes the required format for a Vega-Lite JSON specification. This talk will describe the development of the ‘vlbuildr’ package for building Vega-Lite specifications in R and the ‘vlmetabuildr’ package for building the ‘vlbuildr’ package. The ‘vlbuildr’ package seeks to provide a pipe-friendly, “R-like” functional interface for building up simple to complex specifications for Vega-Lite graphics, which can in turn be rendered as an HtmlWidget by the ‘vegawidget’ R package. Building such an API in a fully automated way from the Vega-Lite schema presents considerable challenges, so the approach taken here was to rely on partial automation. Human judgement dictates the basic contours of the API, such as what groups of functions to include and how various types of building blocks will go together. The part that is automated is filling in many details such as the different variants of a group of functions, the exact parameters needed for each function, and the documentation of those parameters -- the parts that would be extremely tedious to port over!</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Like it or not, SQL is the closest thing we have to a universal language for working with structured data. Celebrating its 50th birthday in 2020, SQL today integrates with thousands of applications and has millions of users worldwide. Data analysts using SQL represent a large audience of potential R users motivated to expand their data science skills. But learning R can be frustrating for SQL users. One major frustration is the inability to directly query R data frames with SQL SELECT statements. Eager to use R for tasks that are not possible with SQL (like data visualization and machine learning), these users are dismayed to find that they must first learn an unfamiliar syntax for data manipulation. The popularity of the sqldf package (which automatically exports an R data frame into an embedded database, then runs a SQL query on it) demonstrates this frustration. But now there is a way to directly query an R data frame without moving the data out of R. In this talk, I introduce tidyquery, a new R package that runs SQL queries directly on R data frames. tidyquery is powered by dplyr and by queryparser, a new pure-R, no-dependency SQL query parser.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">The use of list-columns in data frames and tibbles is well documented (e.g. Bryan, 2018), providing a cognitively efficient way to organize results of complex data (e.g. several statistical models, groupings of text, data summaries, or even graphics) with corresponding data. For example, one can store student information within classrooms, player information within teams, or analyses within groups. This allows the data to be of variable sizes without overly complicating or adding redundancies to the structure of the data. In turn, this can improve the reliability to appropriately analyze the data. Because of its efficiency and speed, being able to use data.table to work with list-columns would be beneficial in many data contexts (e.g. to reduce memory usage in large data sets). Herein, I demonstrate how one can create list-columns in a data table using the by argument in data.table and purrr::map(). I compare the behavior of the data.table approaches to the dplyr::group_nest() function and tidyr::unnest(), two of the several powerful tidyverse nesting and unnesting functions. Results using bench::mark() show the speed and efficiency of using data.table to work with list-columns.</span></p></div></div></p></details><br>

This enables your students to have near realtime access to your code as you write it. The broadcast file can be viewed with any webbrowser but the package is specifically designed to be used within RStudio leveraging its builtin viewer. This gives students have direct access to the shared code within the IDE, allowing direct copying into their own source files and/or the console and thereby improving their ability to interact and experiment with your code.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

This talk describes a series of meaningful lessons that explore research in software engineering for the beginner R programmer by teaching students to interpret and replicate research findings while learning meaningful results for their field in addition to common statistical methods. The lessons serve as a primer for software engineers to participate in a data-driven society; from advertising and business to combating misinformation and helping user experience.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">Peer review enables instructors of large data science classes to provide substantive feedback to students beyond what is feasible with standard code review via automated grading and continuous integration. It facilitates peer learning, which is shown in literature to have positive learning outcomes, and can reduce the burden of grading by course staff. The ghclass package provides a suite of functions to manage courses via GitHub repositories. The package has recently been supplemented with the functionality to implement peer review. Developed during my 2019 summer internship with RStudio in collaboration with my mentor Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, the peer review functions in ghclass interface with the GitHub API to create review repositories, move files between authors and reviewers, submit feedback, and collect grades. In this presentation, I will give a demonstration of the peer review functions in ghclass. A set of six functions allows instructors to 1) create a random review roster, 2) set up the review repository infrastructure within a GitHub organization, 3) move assignments from authors to reviewers, 4) collect grades, 5) return the feedback, and 6) obtain a rating of the review from the authors. I reflect on the pedagogy of implementing peer review in introductory data science classes and talk about lessons learned from a real-world test run of the package in the Fall semester 2019 at the University of Edinburgh, conducted by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel. The presentation highlights ghclass as an R command-line based, open source, low profile, and powerful solution to enable peer review in classes ranging from a size of two to approximately 400 students.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Although data science as a professional discipline is well-established, its pedagogy is still in a period of growth. Even within a single university, multiple data science courses may be offered across different departments leading to inevitable redundancy of efforts amidst rich domain-specific innovations. My experience as an instructor in many such courses has lead me to five principles that transcend domain, context, and choice of language: reproducibility, communication, version control, practical application, and data ethics. For each of these full-stack themes, I will share examples of how to leverage tools in R and RStudio to enhance learning.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">As an intern at RStudio, I developed a blocks-based coding language mimicking the verb-driven programming of the tidyverse. Blocks-based coding environments are a popular way to introduce programming to novices. Instead of typing in code, users click blocks together to create loops, conditionals, and expressions. Studies have shown that students are more successful and more interested in coding when introduced through a block-based language like Scratch or Snap! rather than a text-based language. However, it's much easier to express control flow with these tools than to manipulate data: adding 1 to a variable requires several steps, and there are no built-in capabilities for working with tabular data. On the other hand, R's tidyverse libraries provide a predictable, consistent grammar for doing these tasks. As an intern at RStudio, I developed a blocks-based coding language mimicking the verb driven programming of the tidyverse. Tabular data can be imported and transformed using verbs like filter, select, and summarize, and functions can be strung together using pipes, which users can think of as meaning ""and then"". The talk will include a demo of TidyBlocks and a description of how we're testing and improving it.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Tools like 'rmarkdown' and GitHub facilitate running and sharing outcomes with colleagues and with the broad scientific community at large. However, it is less clear what tools should be used to retrieve, store and share datasets; while it is possible to make datasets part of your workflows today, it is usually hard and we are often left with manually sharing or downloading links to datasets. Not only that, but it's also hard to share or discover datasets. In this talk we will introduce for the first time the 'pins' package. A package designed to: pin, discover and share resources. Meaning that, you can use 'pins' to simplify your data science workflows by easily fetching resources from GitHub, Kaggle, CRAN and RStudio Connect. We will present a 'pin' as a generic resource that can contain tabular datasets like CSVs, unstructured data like JSON files, image archives as ZIP files and so on. This talk will be highly interactive showing you how to get started by installing 'pins' from CRAN, retrieve and cache resources, share and discover useful and fun data resources to improve and enhance your day-to-day workflows.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

<p><div class=""ag87-crtemvc-hsbk""><div class=css-zuif4x><p class=""carina-rte-public-DraftStyleDefault-block""><span style=""color: rgb(0,0,0);"">In Mexico the elections take place on a Sunday, and the official results are presented a week later. To prevent unjustified victory claims during that period the electoral authority organizes a quick count the same night of the election. The quick count consists in selecting a random sample of the polling stations and estimating the percentage of votes in favor of each candidate. With highly competitive electoral processes the quick count has become very important, the rapidity and precision of its results auspicious an environment of trust, and it serves as a tool against fraud. In this application reproducibility is very important. On the scientific side, it is crucial to examine the veracity and robustness of the conclusions of the methodologies. However, in this case, reproducibility is more important still, as it helps to achieve transparency in the electoral procedure. Anyone can download the sample and compute the same results that were announced the night of the election. This transparency fosters trust in institutions and gives legitimacy to the outcome of the quick count. We believe that developing an R package with detailed vignettes made the procedure accessible for the public. The package also facilitated code development and estimation on the election night, when the models were run with partial samples every five minutes, for three different state elections and for the presidential election. Our models were one of 9 different approaches to do the estimation and yet our code is the only publicly available, we are championing for more openness on procedures by sharing our experience. As for the model we developed Bayesian hierarchical models that include demographic and geographic covariates, the purpose of the models is to reduce the biases associated to such covariates due to the fact that complete samples are rarely available to publish the results in a timely manner hence the results are announced using partial samples which have biases.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

Lack of consistency and documentation can lead to lost productivity when team members join collaborations or previous work is consulted by your future self. Setting up folder structures can be particularly tedious. This talk will demonstrate using Rstudio project templates as part of an organizational package to automatically setup file structures, establish git repositories and add standardized readme files. It will also show how including report templates for Rmarkdown files can lead to more consistent and professional reports. Project info can be optionally stored so that project information can be easily added automatically to the top of reports and included in snippets for code file headers. Creating standard, easy to implement documentation and procedures can be particularly effective in encouraging skeptical collaborators to use git and Rmarkdown. Organizational packages can also be a great place to house functions that are specific and common to an organizations needs. The talk will showcase this functionality using the CIDAtools package that we developed. While the CIDAtools package was developed to address issues that sometimes arise from the less structured environment of academia, the tools presented can be equally useful in an industry setting.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>

So far, curators have tweeted from 18 different countries and represent a variety of domains and levels of R expertise, ranging from R novices to those developing their own packages. With 45 R-Ladies curators to date, the account has become a popular R-related twitter resource, gaining more than 13,000 followers in the past year and hundreds of interactions each week. This talk will present a text analysis and reflection on over a year of Twitter text data from @WeAreRLadies. As the founder and maintainer of this account, I witness firsthand the bidirectional relationship between one’s learning journey and their use of R. In this talk, I will attempt to quantify this through a text analysis that explores how one’s experiences learning and using R relates to how they talk (or tweet) about it. By analyzing tweet text as well as other metrics provided by twitter (e.g., number of likes, replies, and clicks), I will showcase different ways curators have engaged with the R Twitter community and explore how account engagement has changed as the number of curators and followers continue to grow. I will also discuss how curators’ different areas of expertise have resulted in tweets and discussions that both demonstrate the variety of tools available in R, and spotlight unifying ideas and best practices in R programming. Finally, I will reflect on lessons learned and future directions for @WeAreRLadies, as well as its contribution to the R-Ladies Global initiative. Overall, this talk will discuss how diverse perspectives of @WeAreRLadies curators have enriched the conversations in the R Twitter community by validating different learning journeys and by promoting and amplifying underrepresented voices.</span></p> </div></div></p></details><br>
